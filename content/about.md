Hi! I'm the person behind this aggressively colorful corner of the internet. I'm very interested in things and stuff.

## What is this?

A blog. A playground. A place to write things down so I don't forget them. Mostly shenanigans.

## Why does it look like this?

Because I wanted it to. Because the web got too boring. Because I have a color palette and I'm not afraid to use it. Because whimsy is underrated.

## The tech stack

- **Hugo** — Static site generator, written in Go, fast as hell
- **Cloudflare Pages** — Hosting, CDN, the works
- **Markdown** — Because my content should outlive any platform
- **CSS** — No frameworks, just vibes and tomfoolery

## Get in touch

Find me wherever people find each other on the internet these days.
