Welcome to the new site! If you're reading this, you've survived the assault on your retinas that is my color palette. Congratulations on your fortitude.

## Why Hugo?

Because sometimes you want your blog posts to be plain text files that you can read in any editor, version control with git, and know will still be readable in 20 years.

Also it's *fast*. Like, absurdly fast. No database, no PHP, just pure unadulterated shenanigans rendered to HTML.

## What's next?

- More posts, probably
- Maybe some actual content instead of placeholder tomfoolery
- Tweaking these colors until they're *just right*

Here's some code, because why not:

```javascript
const vibes = ['radical', 'tubular', 'gnarly'];
vibes.forEach(vibe => console.log(`This site is ${vibe}!`));
```

Stay tuned. Or don't. I'm not your boss.
