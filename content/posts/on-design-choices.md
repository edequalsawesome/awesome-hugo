Everyone's doing clean, minimal, Helvetica-on-white websites these days. And that's fine. Those sites are perfectly readable and professional and *utterly devoid of whimsy*.

## The case for chaos

Remember when the web was fun? When every Geocities page had a different background GIF and at least three "Under Construction" signs? When choosing a color palette meant "all of them"?

I'm not saying we should go back to `<blink>` tags and auto-playing MIDI files. But maybe we overcorrected.

## The palette

Here's what we're working with:

- **Deep Purple** (#471C8C) — The backbone. The vibe anchor.
- **Electric Cyan** (#01BAEF) — For when you need to *grab attention*
- **Surge Yellow** (#FFC914) — Like the soda. Like the 90s.
- **Hot Magenta** (#F038FF) — The wildcard
- **Slime Mint** (#6BFFB8) — Nickelodeon energy

Is it a lot? Yes. Is it readable? Surprisingly, yes. Is it memorable? *Absolutely.*

## The philosophy

Your website should feel like *you*. If you're a buttoned-up corporate consultant, sure, go minimal. But if you grew up watching Nickelodeon and drinking Surge while playing N64, maybe your site should reflect that particular brand of nonsense.

This is mine. It's full of tomfoolery, and I regret nothing.
